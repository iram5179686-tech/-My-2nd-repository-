Past phases 
This repository contains a professionally prepared presentation on Pakistan Studies, focusing on the separation of East Pakistan in 1971 and the political, constitutional, and diplomatic reforms introduced under Zulfikar Ali Bhutto (1971–1973). The file was created using a structured slide-based approach to present historical background, the 1971 national crisis, Bhutto’s rise to leadership, imposition of emergency rule, foreign policy initiatives such as the Simla Agreement 1972, abolition of the One-Unit System, and the formulation and key features of the 1973 Constitution. The presentation is designed for academic use, combining clear headings, chronological flow, and concise explanations to highlight how Bhutto’s leadership helped rebuild Pakistan, strengthen democracy, restore provincial autonomy, and improve international standing, making it suitable for class presentations, assignments, and exam preparation.
